    >> 0. FIX os.system() CONTINUING CODE EXECUTION BEFORE yt-dlp FINISHES DOWNLOADING (this messes up with the metadata application step)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    >> 1. Have it so that, upon finding there is no metadata for track title, search name gets auto filled into that spot
    >> 2. Make output to console be a lot less spacey (instead of one line per item, one line per action and update line text for progress)
    >> 3. Make it a lot more functional and less whatever this mess is
    >> 4. Have it so that, upon finding YT link and realizing there is no metadata at all, try to scrape metadata from YT?
