/-/ Ideas for future improvement \-\

  /-/ TODO: \-\

    >> 1. Update README
    >> 2. Have it so that, upon finding there is no metadata for track title, search name gets auto filled into that spot
    >> 3. Make output to console be a lot less spacey (instead of one line per item, one line per action and update line text for progress)
    >> 4. Make it a lot more functional and less whatever this mess is
    >> 5. Have it so that, upon finding YT link and realizing there is no metadata at all, try to scrape metadata from YT?
