// Quick Example Track List

// MP3 Track files will have their metadata encoded as follows:

  // YouTube Search Name / File Name || Artist || Album Title || Track Title

// All metadata fields are optional, and will be left empty if not included
// If you wish to include a later field (such as Track Name) but not the previous ones, you can write NULL for the blank fields:

  // FileSlashSearchName || NULL || NULL || TrackTitle

// And there is more:
// If you encode the first track parameter (File / Search Name) as

  // Artist - Track Title

// With that neat '-' separator, these fields (Artist and Track Title) will be assumed for metadata info
// This way, your encodings will only be lacking the Album Title, and will look something like this:

  // Artist - Track Title || Album Title

// Here are a few examples:

TOOL - Lateralus || Lateralus
Frank Sinatra - That's Life || Nothing But The Best
Never Gonna Give You Up || Rick Astley || Whenever You Need Somebody || Never Gonna Give You Up

// : )

// 93 / 93
